# QA Automation Pipeline Integrated

## Overview
**`qa-automation-pipeline-integrated`** is a comprehensive QA automation pipeline that integrates UI, API, and performance testing into a single continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The goal of this project is to ensure that applications are tested efficiently and that performance, functionality, and security are validated automatically with each code change.

This pipeline uses various tools like **Cypress** for UI testing, **Postman + Newman** for API testing, and **K6** for performance testing, all integrated into **GitHub Actions** to ensure automated testing and reporting.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Cypress**: For UI testing and end-to-end testing of the applicationâ€™s user interface.
- **Postman + Newman**: For API testing and validation.
- **K6**: For performance testing, measuring application load and stress handling.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD integration, automating the execution of tests upon every code change.
- **Grafana Cloud**: For visualizing performance test results and metrics generated by K6.

---

## Features
- **UI Testing**: Automated end-to-end testing of the user interface using Cypress, including responsiveness and negative tests.
- **API Testing**: Automated API testing using Postman and Newman, with generated HTML reports.
- **Performance Testing**: Integration of K6 for load testing, with real-time results pushed to Grafana Cloud.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for automating the testing process in every push to the repository.
- **Detailed Reporting**: HTML and Mochawesome reports for API and UI test results, with performance metrics visualized in Grafana.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **Git** (for version control)
- **Cypress** (for UI testing)
- **Postman** and **Newman** (for API testing)
- **K6** (for performance testing)

### Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/qa-automation-pipeline-integrated.git
cd qa-automation-pipeline-integrated
```

### Install Dependencies
Run the following commands to install the required dependencies for each testing tool:

```bash
# Install Cypress dependencies
npm install cypress

# Install Postman Newman dependencies
npm install newman

# Install K6
# Follow installation instructions on: https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/
```

## Setup GitHub Actions

1. **Configure GitHub Actions**: Ensure that your GitHub repository has the correct `.github/workflows/ci.yml` configuration file for CI/CD integration. This file should define the steps to run Cypress, Postman, and K6 tests automatically.

2. **Set up Secrets**: If using any sensitive data (e.g., API keys, tokens), make sure to add them as **GitHub Secrets** under your repository settings.

3. **Add Reporting Configuration**: If you are using Mochawesome or any other reporting tools, configure them within your test scripts. Example:

```bash
newman run collection.json -r html,mochawesome
```

---

## Running the Tests

### UI Tests (Cypress)
To run the UI tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open  # Opens Cypress UI for manual test execution
```

Or, for headless testing:

```bash
npx cypress run --headless --browser chrome
```

### API Tests (Postman + Newman)
To execute the API tests using Newman, run:

```bash
newman run api-collection.json -r html,mochawesome
```

### Performance Tests (K6)
Run performance tests using K6:

```bash
k6 run performance-test.js
```

Ensure that your K6 test scripts are configured to push metrics to **Grafana Cloud**.

---

## Reports and Results

- **UI and API Test Reports**: Results from Cypress and Newman are available in the generated HTML and Mochawesome reports. These can be found in the `/reports` folder.
  
- **Performance Test Reports**: K6 performance metrics can be viewed in **Grafana Cloud**. Ensure your Grafana credentials and settings are correctly configured to display the metrics.

---

## CI/CD Integration

This project is fully integrated with **GitHub Actions**. On each push to the repository, the following tasks are automated:
- Running **Cypress UI tests**
- Running **Newman API tests**
- Running **K6 performance tests**

The results of these tests are pushed back to GitHub, and reports are generated for easy tracking and monitoring.

### GitHub Actions Workflow Example:
```yaml
name: QA Automation Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  cypress-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Cypress tests
        run: npx cypress run --headless --browser chrome

  newman-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Postman tests
        run: newman run api-collection.json -r html,mochawesome

  k6-performance-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
