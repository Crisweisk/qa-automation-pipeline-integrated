QA Automation Pipeline Integrated 🚀

This project is a complete QA automation pipeline that integrates three types of professional testing in a clean and scalable structure:

🧪 API Testing with Postman + Newman

🖥️ UI Testing with Cypress

📊 Performance Testing with K6, including professional dashboards in Grafana Cloud

This repository is an evolution and integration of two previously completed projects:

crud-postman-qa-automation

playwright-ui-automation-orangehrm

Both were merged here to demonstrate a realistic, scalable, and professional full QA automation pipeline.
